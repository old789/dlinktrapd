This daemon is designed to receive and record in the syslog trap for utilities
SmartConsole, used to control some models of switches D-Link.
Some of these models (e.g. DES-1100) have no other Alert functions 
(ie no support either syslog, or SNMP).

ATTENTION! Not to be confused with the SNMP-traps!
